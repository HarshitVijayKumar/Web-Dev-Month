            <area shape="circle" coords="123,185,14" alt = "cat" onclick="threaten()">
        </map>

        <h3 title="Day-2" id="Day1">Day-1</h3>
        <p title="Day-2"> Day-1 covered the basics of HTML, I learnt the layout of a webpage,
        learnt how to add paragraphs, images, links and how to control were those links open their webpages at.<br>
        I also learnt how to add borders although they were not working very well yet. I discovered titles
        Anything you write there pops up when you hover over it, I have planned to <br>use it to keep track of the elements and the day they were added</p>
        <h3 title="Day-3" id="Day2">Day-2</h3>
        <p title="Day-3">
            Day-2 began with CSS and using a CSS file to change the whole style of the webpage. I settled on External CSS.<br>
            Then I learned how to make images into links and transformed my insta and blog link to an image.<br>
            I also attempted to make a button into a link but that part seemed to be trickier than it looked.<br>
            Than I created a bookmark and decided on the actual content of the site. The site will document the chages done <br>
            everyday and will have a photo of those changes attached alongside them.
