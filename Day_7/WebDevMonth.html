                <p title="Day-1">
                    This is a month dedicated to <ins>Web Dev</ins>. Every day I have to learn something new and add to this site<br>
                    It began on <b>9 September</b>.
                </p>

                <p title="Day-2">
                    What will follows are paragraphs about the things I learnt on a day and my thoughts on that day.
                    What will be attached with everyday is a screenshot of how the site looked each day.
                </p>

                <h3 title="Day-2" id="Day1">Day-1</h3>
                <p title="Day-2">
                    Day-1 covered the basics of HTML, I learnt the layout of a webpage,
                    learnt how to add paragraphs, images, links and how to control were those links open their webpages at.<br>
                    I also learnt how to add borders although they were not working very well yet. I discovered titles.
                    Anything you write there pops up when you hover over it, I have planned to use it to keep track of the elements and the day they were added
                </p>
 
                <h3 title="Day-3" id="Day2">Day-2</h3>
                <p title="Day-3">
                    Day-2 began with CSS and using a CSS file to change the whole style of the webpage. I settled on External CSS.<br>
                    Then I learned how to make images into links and transformed my insta and blog link to an image.<br>
                    I also attempted to make a button into a link but that part seemed to be trickier than it looked.<br>
                    Than I created a bookmark and decided on the actual content of the site. The site will document the chages done <br>
                    everyday and will have a photo of those changes attached alongside them.
                </p>

                <h3 title="Day-4" id="Day3">Day-3</h3>
                <p title="Day-4">
                    On Day-3, I learned image maps, I edited the cat picture to include a Sharengan. Click the eye for a surprise!<br>
                    I also made the icon for the webpage which is a cat peeking at you!
                </p>

                <h3 title="Day-5" id="Day4">Day-4</h3>
                <p title="Day-5">
                    Day-4 was hard, it was hard to focus and complete the day. I was only able to add a table which had problems
                    in adding the image in it and setting its size. The Web-Dev Month has also started consuming a lot of time and
                    I am wondering to restrict the time I invest each day.<br> I was also able to design a navigation bar<br>
                </p>

                <h3 title="Day-6" id="Day5">Day-5</h3>
                <p title="Day-6">
                    I finally fixed the table, the images finally fit into the columns better. I discovered Iframes and implemented them
                    now using that to display the table fully.<br>
                    I also added a list at the end of the webpage.<br>
                    I also used JavaScript to add a credits button in the end.<br>
                </p>

                <h3 title="Day-7" id="Day6">Day-6</h3>
                <p title="Day-7">
                    Learned about the meta tags and added them.<br>
                    Modified the Layout,<br>
                    Retired Early.<br>
